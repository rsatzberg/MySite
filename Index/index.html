<h2>My School</h2>
<img src="college-photo_31616.jpg">
<p> I attend the University of New Haven in Connecticut. I am a Music and Sound Recording Major with a minor in both Economics and Theater Arts. I am the Station Manager of our radio station, WNHU, where I also co-host a show called The Twist on Tuesday nights. I am also a Resident Assistant in Gerber Hall with the Music LLC. I am a rising senior, set to graduate in May of 2020.</p>
<h3>Fun Stuff</h3>
<img src="TrinityTheatre_SD9.jpeg">
<p>My hobbies include listening to music, recording musicians and mixing songs.I love working with people and volunteering my time to causes I care about. I have been working with my university's theater department for the past year, working sound for shows. I recently ran the sound board for my first show, and I am the foley artist for the upcoming production of Mr. Burns: A Post Electric Play. I hope to have a career in sound for theater, or in sound engineering.</p>
